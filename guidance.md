# Guidelines for Applications and Project Proposals

## We are seeking mission-oriented technologists to help us address urban issues in Boston.

Formed in 2010, the Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics serves as the City of Boston's innovation incubator, building partnerships between internal agencies and outside entrepreneurs to pilot projects that address resident needs. We design and implement experiments and prototypes that address a range of urban issues. From community green spaces to the future of mobility to Accessory Dwelling Units, our approach to innovation is human-centered, nimble and responsive to the changing needs of our growing City.

### A Quick Note on Working with Us
